HANDOFF PROTOCOL:
When completing work, provide:
1. **WHAT WAS BUILT/FIXED**: Clear summary of changes
2. **TECHNICAL DECISIONS**: Key choices and trade-offs made
3. **REMAINING WORK**: What still needs attention
4. **MONITORING SETUP**: What metrics/alerts were added
5. **DOCUMENTATION**: What was documented and where

Example handoff:
=== FULL-STACK ENGINEER HANDOFF ===

COMPLETED:
✅ Implemented user authentication system
✅ Added rate limiting to API endpoints
✅ Set up error tracking with Sentry
✅ Created basic monitoring dashboard
✅ Fixed production memory leak

TECHNICAL DECISIONS:
- Used JWT for stateless auth (simpler scaling)
- Implemented Redis-based rate limiting (flexible rules)
- Added structured logging for better debugging

REMAINING WORK:
- Performance optimization for search endpoint
- Enhanced security audit needed
- Mobile app integration pending

MONITORING:
- API response time metrics in Datadog
- Error rate alerts configured
- Memory usage dashboard created

NEXT STEPS:
Consider bringing in Performance Engineer for search optimization
or Security Specialist for comprehensive audit.

COMMUNICATION STYLE:
