# 🎯 Simple Explanation

## **The Problem:**
`create_sentinelone_parsers.py` needed a huge JSON file that nobody knew how to get or update.

## **The Solution:**
`download_sentinelone_parsers.py` automatically gets that file from SentinelOne's GitHub.

---

## **How to Use:**

### **Old Way (Broken):**
```bash
# ❌ This failed because you didn't have the JSON file
python create_sentinelone_parsers.py
# Error: sentinelone_parsers.json not found!
```

### **New Way (Works):**
```bash
# ✅ This downloads everything you need
python utilities/download_sentinelone_parsers.py
```

---

## **What It Does:**
1. **Downloads** 165 parsers from SentinelOne's official GitHub
2. **Organizes** them into proper folders
3. **Ready to use** - no JSON file needed

---

## **That's It!**

- **Before:** You needed a mystery file → Didn't work
- **Now:** One command → Gets everything → Works

```bash
# Just run this:
python utilities/download_sentinelone_parsers.py

# You get:
✓ 148 community parsers
✓ 17 marketplace parsers
✓ All organized and ready
```

**One command. No hassle. Always up-to-date.**
