# Complex API Test Plan - Enterprise Attack Simulation

**Test Plan Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** August 31, 2025  
**Objective:** Validate API robustness under complex, real-world enterprise attack simulation scenarios

---

## Test Overview

This complex test plan simulates a sophisticated enterprise security operations center (SOC) using the Jarvis Coding API to detect and respond to a multi-stage APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) attack across multiple systems simultaneously.

### Test Complexity Dimensions
1. **Concurrent Operations**: 50+ parallel API calls
2. **Multi-User Simulation**: 10 different API keys with varying roles
3. **Long-Running Operations**: Scenario executions lasting 30+ minutes
4. **High Volume**: 100,000+ events generated
5. **Error Recovery**: Intentional failures and recovery testing
6. **Rate Limiting**: Push boundaries of rate limits
7. **Integration Complexity**: Chain multiple API operations

## Phase 1: Initial Reconnaissance Simulation (15 minutes)

### Test Objectives
- Simulate 5 security analysts simultaneously investigating suspicious activity
- Generate reconnaissance events from multiple sources
- Test search and filtering capabilities under load

### Test Steps

#### 1.1 Concurrent Generator Execution
```python
# Simulate 5 analysts running different generators simultaneously
analysts = [
    {"api_key": "analyst_1_key", "role": "read"},
    {"api_key": "analyst_2_key", "role": "read"},
    {"api_key": "analyst_3_key", "role": "write"},
    {"api_key": "analyst_4_key", "role": "write"},
    {"api_key": "analyst_5_key", "role": "admin"}
]

generators_to_execute = [
    "aws_cloudtrail",
    "cisco_umbrella", 
    "zscaler",
    "cloudflare_waf",
    "google_cloud_dns"
]

# Each analyst executes 10 generators with 100 events each
# Total: 5 analysts × 10 generators × 100 events = 5,000 events
```

#### 1.2 Simultaneous Search Operations
```python
search_queries = [
    {"query": "failed login", "resource_type": "generator"},
    {"query": "suspicious", "resource_type": "all"},
    {"query": "admin", "resource_type": "parser"},
    {"query": "firewall", "category": "network_security"},
    {"query": "aws", "vendor": "amazon"}
]

# Execute 100 search queries in parallel
# Test search service under heavy concurrent load
```

#### 1.3 Metrics Collection Storm
```python
# Bombard metrics endpoint with requests
# 500 requests in 60 seconds (test rate limiting)
for i in range(500):
    GET /api/v1/metrics/dashboard
    GET /api/v1/metrics/generators
    GET /api/v1/metrics/errors
    # Expect rate limiting to kick in after 100 requests/minute
```

### Success Criteria
- All concurrent operations complete successfully
- Rate limiting properly enforces limits
- No memory leaks or performance degradation
- Search results remain accurate under load

    {"scenario_id": "enterprise_attack", "speed": "fast"},
    {"scenario_id": "ransomware_sim", "speed": "instant"},
    {"scenario_id": "insider_threat", "speed": "fast"},
    {"scenario_id": "cloud_breach", "speed": "realtime"},

# Create mega-batch of 50 generators
batch_request = {
    "generators": [all_106_generators][:50],  # Max batch size
    "count_per_generator": 1000,  # 50,000 total events
    "parallel": true
}

# Execute and measure:
# - Time to complete
# - Memory usage
# - CPU utilization
# - Error rate
```

#### 2.3 Event Streaming Stress Test
```python
# Open 10 concurrent streaming connections
streams = []
for i in range(10):
    stream = StreamEvents(
        generator_id=f"generator_{i}",
        count=10000,
        interval_ms=100  # 10 events per second per stream
    )
    streams.append(stream)

# Total: 100 events/second across all streams
# Run for 10 minutes = 60,000 events
```

### Success Criteria
- All scenarios execute without conflicts
- Batch operations handle 50,000 events
- Streaming maintains consistent throughput
- No data corruption or loss

## Phase 3: Incident Response Simulation (20 minutes)

### Test Objectives

#### 3.1 Mass Export Operations
```python
# Simulate exporting evidence for incident
export_formats = ["json", "csv", "ndjson", "syslog", "cef"]

for format in export_formats:
    # Export from 20 generators simultaneously
    POST /api/v1/export/batch
    {
        "generators": [list_of_20_generators],
        "count_per_generator": 500,
        "format": format
    }

# Total: 5 formats × 20 generators × 500 events = 50,000 events exported
```

#### 3.2 Chaos Engineering - Intentional Failures
```python
chaos_tests = [
    # Invalid authentication
    {"api_key": "invalid_key_12345"},
    
    # Malformed requests
    {"generator_id": None, "count": -1},
    
    # Non-existent resources
    GET /api/v1/generators/does_not_exist,
    
    # Oversized requests
    {"count": 1000000},  # Way over limit
    
    # SQL injection attempts
    {"query": "'; DROP TABLE users; --"},
    
    # XSS attempts
    {"name": "<script>alert('xss')</script>"}
]

# Verify all attacks are properly rejected
# Ensure system remains stable
```

#### 3.3 Recovery Testing
```python
# Simulate recovery from various failure states
recovery_tests = [
    # Stop scenario mid-execution and restart
    "stop_and_resume_scenario",
    
    # Cancel batch operation and retry
    "cancel_batch_retry",
    
    # Reconnect dropped streaming connections
    "stream_reconnection",
    
    # Handle rate limit recovery
    "rate_limit_backoff"
]
```

### Success Criteria
