# Parser-Generator Compatibility Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

We have identified **40 compatibility issues** across 100+ security parsers and generators. 
These issues prevent optimal field extraction and OCSF compliance in the SentinelOne AI SIEM platform.

### Prioritized Implementation Phases:

**Phase 1 - Critical (Week 1-2): 12 issues**
- Focus on Tier 1 security vendors (AWS, Microsoft, Cisco, etc.)
- Highest business impact and security coverage
- Endpoint security, identity, and cloud infrastructure priority

**Phase 2 - High Priority (Week 3-4): 3 issues**  
- Tier 2 vendors and remaining critical systems
- Network security and email security platforms
- Moderate complexity format conversions

**Phase 3 - Medium Priority (Week 5-6): 25 issues**
- Tier 3 specialized vendors
- Star Trek character integration for testing
- Infrastructure and supporting systems

**Phase 4 - Automation (Week 7-8)**
- Automated compatibility testing framework
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Prevention of future format mismatches

### Success Metrics:
- **90%+ OCSF compliance** for Tier 1 vendors
- **Complete Star Trek integration** for testing scenarios
- **Automated validation** to prevent regressions
- **80%+ field extraction** improvement for critical parsers

### Resource Requirements:
- 1-2 engineers for 8 weeks
- Comprehensive testing environment
- Backup and rollback procedures
- Documentation and training materials
